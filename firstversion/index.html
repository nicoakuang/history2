            Background: The 1940 Global Crisis and China's Isolation
          </h2>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            In June 1940, the rapidly shifting landscape of World War II profoundly impacted the Republic of China (中華民國, *Zhōnghuá Mínguó*) amidst its War of Resistance against Japan. On June 14, German forces broke through France's Maginot Line and occupied Paris. Subsequently, the French government signed an armistice agreement with Germany on June 22, formally entering the Vichy France era. This collaborationist government, under German influence, created a dangerous opportunity for Japanese imperialists in Asia.
          </p>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Shortly after the fall of France, on June 20, Japan (日本, *Rìběn*) instructed the newly formed Vichy French administration to close the crucial supply route to China—the Indochina Railway (滇越鐵路, *Diānyuè Tiělù*). This action severely hampered the transport of essential war materials for the Republic of China's resistance efforts, virtually severing China's external communication lifeline.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Just a few days later, Japan further demanded that Britain close the Burma Road (滇緬公路, *Diānyuǎn Gōnglù*), another vital international communication route. Facing immense pressure from the war in Europe, the British government announced on July 18 the implementation of a three-month embargo, plunging the Republic of China into a state where its external communications were almost entirely cut off. In response to this dire situation, the Republic of China government issued this official statement, titled "Declaration of the Chinese Government." This powerful document, believed to be personally annotated by Former President Chiang Kai-shek (先總統蔣介石, *Xiān Zǒngtǒng Jiǎng Jièshí*), conveyed the heavy resolve of a nation facing an existential crisis.
          </p>

          <h2 id="the-declaration" class="fade-in-section">
            The Declaration of the Chinese Government
          </h2>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            French Indochina (法屬越南, *Fǎshǔ Yuènán*), both geographically and in terms of transportation, has always maintained a close relationship. From the perspective of commercial and economic needs, mutually beneficial interests have been established over the years, making them inseparable. Indochina especially serves as a crucial international communication route for our country, bearing immense significance for our prosperity and security.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            China and France have signed several treaties concerning French Indochina. The most recent one is the "Sino-French Convention on the Relationship between Indochina and China's Border Provinces (中法規定越南及中國邊省關係專約, *Zhōngfǎ Guīdìng Yuènán jí Zhōngguó Biānsheng Guānxì Zhuānyuē*)," which was signed on May 16, 1930, and came into effect on July 22, 1935. According to the provisions of this treaty, France allows various goods, including military equipment and armaments, to pass through Indochina. Article Six further explicitly stipulates: "All military supplies and armaments transported by the Chinese government, when passing through Tonkin (東京, *Dōngjīng*) (Indochina), shall be exempt from any duties or taxes."
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Resolutions from previous sessions of the League of Nations (國際聯合會, *Guójì Liánhéhuì*) stipulate that all member states, including France, should avoid any actions that could diminish China's capacity for resistance and should consider individually assisting China to some extent.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The Chinese government, in view of France's aforementioned specific obligations, has the right to demand that France fulfill its obligations and maintain the international communication route through Indochina. However, in recent years, considering the difficulties of France's circumstances, China has empathized with the hardships of the French government, and has not demanded the passage of military equipment and armaments through Indochina. This is the Chinese government's most friendly gesture and greatest forbearance.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Since the Chinese government has already accommodated France's wishes and shown utmost humility, it is truly baffling that the French government now responds by prohibiting the passage of various goods through Indochina, effectively blockading China's crucial entry and exit routes, even severing our international communication. The impact of this ban is extremely severe. The Chinese government cannot but regard this as a most unfriendly act, and one that is unacceptable to the Chinese people. For France to impose a blockade towards its friendly ally is already utterly unreasonable, let alone considering its obligations under treaties and the League of Nations.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The sudden change in attitude by the French government this time will inevitably encourage disruptors of peace in the Far East. Regarding this matter, the Chinese government cannot but take appropriate measures. It must be recognized that if Japan engages in any military aggression in any region of Asia or the Pacific, regardless of its form, the Chinese government deeply believes that its sole purpose is to annihilate China's survival and independence. Therefore, if Japan takes any military action in various places in Asia and the Pacific, and if it obstructs China's legitimate rights, especially those related to China's economic communication, China, for the sake of its survival, independence, and preservation of rights, cannot but be forced to adopt necessary measures under such circumstances. Hence, this declaration.

            The Lushan Speech: A Call to Total Resistance (1937)
          </h2>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The "Declaration of the Chinese Government" in 1940 echoed a spirit of unyielding resistance articulated earlier by Former President Chiang Kai-shek. On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident (盧溝橋事變, *Lúgōuqiao Shìbiàn*) erupted near Beijing, marking the full-scale outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War (中日戰爭, *Zhōng-Rì Zhànzhēng*). Ten days later, on July 17, Chiang delivered a pivotal address at Lushan (廬山, *Lúshān*), outlining China's resolve to fight.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="fade-in-section">
            <p>
              "We know that once the nation is compelled to engage in war, there is no hope of escaping sacrifice. If war breaks out, then regardless of north or south, young or old, everyone has the responsibility to defend their homeland and resist aggression. Everyone must resolve to sacrifice everything."

          </blockquote>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            This speech galvanized the nation, setting the stage for eight years of arduous struggle. The 1940 Declaration, in turn, reaffirmed China's determination to resist external pressures and maintain its sovereignty, even as the global geopolitical landscape drastically changed.
