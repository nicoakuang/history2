            Background Context: The Global Situation in 1940
          </h2>

          <p class="fade-in-section first-paragraph">
            On June 14, 1940, German forces broke through France's Maginot Line and occupied Paris. On June 22, the French government and the German government signed an armistice agreement. On June 20, France, acting under Japanese instructions, closed the Indochina Railway (滇越鐵路, <span class="pinyin">Diānyuè Tiělù</span>) to traffic with China. The "Declaration of the Chinese Government" was issued precisely in response to this matter. On the 24th, Japan (日本, <span class="pinyin">Rìběn</span>) further demanded that Britain close the Burma Road (滇緬公路, <span class="pinyin">Diānyuǎn Gōnglù</span>) to traffic with China. The British government subsequently announced that, effective July 18, a three-month embargo would be implemented, thereby almost completely severing China's external communication.

          <h2 id="the-declaration" class="fade-in-section">
            The Declaration of the Chinese Government
          </h2>

          <p class="fade-in-section">
            French Indochina (法屬越南, <span class="pinyin">Fǎshǔ Yuènán</span>), in terms of geography and communication, has always maintained a close relationship. From the perspective of commercial and balanced economic needs, mutually beneficial interests have been enjoyed for many years; thus, the two are inseparable. Indochina especially serves as an international communication route for our country, bearing immense significance for our country's prosperity and security.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            China and France have signed several treaties concerning French Indochina. The most recent is the "Sino-French Convention on the Relationship between Indochina and China's Border Provinces (中法規定越南及中國邊省關係專約, <span class="pinyin">Zhōngfǎ Guīdìng Yuènán jí Zhōngguó Biānsheng Guānxì Zhuānyuē</span>)," concluded on May 16, 1930, and effective July 22, 1935. According to the provisions of this treaty, France permits various goods, including military equipment and armaments, to pass through Indochina. Furthermore, Article Six explicitly stipulates: "All military supplies and armaments transported by the Chinese government, when passing through Tonkin (東京, <span class="pinyin">Dōngjīng</span>) (Indochina), shall be exempt from any duties or taxes."
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Resolutions from previous sessions of the League of Nations (國際聯合會, <span class="pinyin">Guójì Liánhéhuì</span>) stipulate that all member states, including France, should avoid any actions that could diminish China's capacity for resistance and should consider individually assisting China.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The Chinese government, in view of France's aforementioned specific obligations, has the right to demand that France fulfill its obligations and maintain the international communication route through Indochina. However, in recent years, considering France's difficult circumstances, China has therefore empathized with the hardships of the French government.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Regarding military equipment and armaments through Indochina, China did not demand passage. This was China's most friendly gesture and also its greatest forbearance.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            Since the Chinese government has already accommodated France's wishes and shown utmost humility, it is truly baffling that the French government now responds by prohibiting the passage of various goods through Indochina, effectively blockading China's crucial entry and exit routes, even severing our international communication.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The impact of this ban is extremely severe. The Chinese government cannot but regard this as a most unfriendly act, which is unacceptable to the Chinese people. For France to impose a blockade upon its friendly ally is already utterly unreasonable, let alone considering its obligations under treaties and the League of Nations.
          </p>
          <p class="fade-in-section">
            The French government's sudden change in attitude this time will inevitably encourage disruptors of peace in the Far East. Regarding this matter, the Chinese government cannot but take appropriate measures, for it must be known that if Japan engages in any military aggression or action in any region of Asia or the Pacific, regardless of its form, our Chinese government deeply believes that its sole purpose is to annihilate China's survival and independence. Therefore, if Japan takes any military action in various places in Asia and the Pacific, and if it obstructs China's legitimate rights—especially those related to China's economic communication—China, for the sake of its survival, independence, and preservation of rights, cannot but be forced by Japan to adopt necessary measures under such circumstances. Hence, this declaration.

              "We know that once the nation is compelled to engage in war, there is no hope of escaping sacrifice.
